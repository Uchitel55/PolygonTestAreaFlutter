# Flutter: Polygons Test Area

#### Description:
Exploring Canvas, CustomPaint and CustomPainter by applying basic trigonometry in Flutter.
CustomPaint widget provides a Canvas for us to use.
Canvas allows us to create some elements on the screen, which we can't create normally using ready to use widgets.
We use the CustomPainter class to write logic for painting.
